# ML-for-Precancerous-Colorectal-Neoplasia
Code for "Immune-Enhanced Machine Learning Approach for Early Detection of Precancerous Colorectal Neoplasia"

## Project Overview  
This repository contains the official implementation of the study  
**"Immune-Enhanced Machine Learning Approach for Early Detection of Precancerous Colorectal Neoplasia"**,  
published in *European Journal of Cancer (2025)*.  

We developed machine learning models that integrate **immune biomarkers (especially NK cell activity, NKA)** with routine health checkup data to improve the early detection of precancerous colorectal neoplasia.

## Highlights  
- Immune-informed ML models accurately predict precancerous colorectal lesions  
- TabNet achieved AUC of 0.734–0.739 with 10 selected clinical variables  
- Low NKA was strongly associated with neoplasia, especially in females  
- False-positive predictions revealed latent long-term neoplastic risk  
- Study supports sex-specific, non-invasive screening using immune markers  

## Dataset Information  
- Cohort: 6,146 asymptomatic adults (2015–2023, CHA University, Korea)  
- Examinations: Same-day colonoscopy and blood-based immune biomarker testing (including NKA)  
- Data sharing: De-identified data may be available upon request to the corresponding authors with IRB approval
